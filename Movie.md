In the year **1999** a movie was released that would later become a household name, *The Matrix.* This movie integrated concepts of virtual reality and AI into a mind-bending, action packed thriller that asks the question *What if the nature of our reality was a lie?*. In my opinion, the movie is a sci-fi masterpiece and one of the greatest films of all time.

The movie follows the story of Thomas Anderson, a software programmer by day and computer hacker by night. Thomas encounters a fellow hacker by the name of Trinity, who refers to him by his hacker name, Neo. Trinity introduces Neo to a man named Morpheus, who explains the answer to a question Neo has been asking, *"What is The Matrix?"*. Morpheus explains to Neo that what he believes to be real, is in fact a virtual reality construct of a malevolent race of AI machines. This virtual reality program, called **The Matrix** was designed to enslave humans while the machines utilized their bioelectricity to power themselves. 

Morpheus and his band of rebels help free Neo from **The Matrix** and guide him through a set of training programs designed to enhance his combat abilities as well as get him accustomed to the lack of physical contstraints that is characterstic of the virtual reality program. Morpheus believes Neo to be some sort of prophet and decides to take him to visit an oracle, so that she may guide Neo on his path of eventually freeing all of humanity. To do this, Morpheus and company have to take Neo back into **The Matrix**, and are betrayed by fellow crew-member Cypher. Ultimately Cypher is killed, but a few of the crew members are also killed in the process and their leader Morpheus is captured by machine programs known as Agents. These Agents are considered to be invincible and extremely dangerous to any human that rejects the reality of **The Matrix**. 

Neo and Trinity narrowly escaped capture by the Agents and exit **The Matrix**. Shortly after, Neo recalls his conversation with **the oracle** and decides to re-enter **The Matrix** to save Morpheus. Following a series of action-sequences, including some good-ole **bullet dodging**, the duo eventually find Morpheus and successfullly save him. While attempting to escape **The Matrix** Neo is trapped inside and faces off with the head Agent, **Agent Smith**. In what can only be described as a modern sci-fi, Bruce Lee-esque showdown, Neo ultimately defeats this supposedly invincible foe, making a statement in the argument of him being the prophesized **One**.
